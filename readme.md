# What?
Http Server in C

# Why?
- for learning
    + Http Protocol
    + C in general (maybe in detail too, i guess?)
    + Makefile (tbh any build system, for once)
    + C Compiler and its arguments (i still dont know how includes work)
    + Maintaining external dependencies (Vendor folder)
    
    + ### Optional Extras
        - compiling routes to shared objects and dynamically loading them
